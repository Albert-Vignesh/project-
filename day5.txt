             * Sum of all numbers in an array

             * Return all the palindromes in an array

             * Return median of two sorted arrays of the same size.

                     There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size n. Find the median of the two sorted arrays.

                     You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

                     Example 1:

                     nums1 = [1, 3]
                     nums2 = [2, 4]
                     The median is 2.5 as (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
                     Example 2:

                     nums1 = [1, 2, 9]
                     nums2 = [3, 4, 7]
                     The median is (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5 
 
             * Remove duplicates from an array
